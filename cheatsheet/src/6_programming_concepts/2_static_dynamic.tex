\subsection{Static vs Dynamically Typed}
C++ is statically typed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each element has a type defined by the programmer.
    \item Types used fitting together correctly is checked at compilation, yielding compile time errors (happen during the program itself) if wrong.
\end{itemize}
Python is dynamically typed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Elements have no type in advance.
    \item At runtime the type is chosen.
    \item Type changeable at runtime.
    \item Depending on the type when executing, there may be runtime errrors (happen during the program).
    \item Errors are more difficult to debug, do not happen all the time.
\end{itemize}
