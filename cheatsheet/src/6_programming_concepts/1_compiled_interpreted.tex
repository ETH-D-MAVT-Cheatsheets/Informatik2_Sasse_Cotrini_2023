\subsection{Compiled vs Interpreted}
Compiled (C++):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Program code is translated to assembly.
    \item Assembly is executed.
    \item Single translation, with optimizations.
    \item Usually, higher performance
\end{itemize}
Interpreted (Python):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Program code executed together with translation.
    \item Translation is repeated each time.
    \item Quick and easy to make minor changes.
\end{itemize}
