\subsection{Invariants}
The invariant is a condition in an algorithm involving a loop.\\
\begin{tabular}{l | p{0.3\linewidth} | p{0.3\linewidth}}
    Phase & Description & Example (list 'a' is sorted until index 'i')\\
    \hline \hline
    1. Initialization & the condition is met before the loop & i = 0, a[:i] = a[0] \\
    \hline
    2. Continuation & the condition holds at each iteration & i = j, a[:j] \\
    \hline
    3. Termination & the condition holds at the end of the loop & i = n, a[:n] = a[n]
