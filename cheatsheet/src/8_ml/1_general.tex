create functions which map inputs to desired outputs
\begin{itemize}
    \item Regression: find output value based on input. Example: given a house has 5 bedrooms, 1000 square meters, what is its price?
    \item Classification: assign element to a group. Example: the first mushroom is edible, the second is not.
\end{itemize}

Models:
Decision tree classifier
Linear Regression $y = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 +...+ w_n x_n$
Neural Network and activation function (Sigmoid, Relu, Tanh)

Loss function:
$\frac{\text{\# wrongly classified examples}}{\text{\# total examples}}$
Mean Square Error
L2 (Gauss Loss)

Test:
R2-Score $1 - \frac{MSE(D, f)}{MSE(D, f_0)}, f_0 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 0}^{n} y_i$
